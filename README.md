# BAYPLAN

**Field Instrument #075.** A workshop floor planner that plans for how a shop actually works, not just where the boxes sit.

A bayplan is the stowage diagram for a ship's cargo bays. This one stows a workshop: scale-accurate, imperial, snap-to-grid, and single-file HTML in the local-first fleet posture. The whole plan is one JSON document that exports and imports cleanly, no server required.

## What makes it an instrument, not a floor planner

Three things, all in the data model rather than the UI:

1. **Clearance envelopes, not just footprints.** Every machine carries its real working halo: a table saw's infeed and outfeed, a lathe's outboard swing, a welder's spark standoff. Overlap two halos and the checker flags it, with a hard / soft / shared rule so a table saw's outfeed can legitimately share an aisle while a blade path never can.
2. **Material flow as a first-class overlay.** Draw the path stock takes from rack to assembly; the tool derives backtracking and crossing traffic.
3. **A typed utilities graph.** Electrical, dust, air, and data as a graph, so duct runs get measured and circuit loads roll up instead of being drawn as dumb lines.

## Status

Scaffold, v0.0.1. This release stands up the structure: the geometry core (rect-off-edge resolution, point-in-arc, and the placement transform with mirroring), the embedded built-in library, the SVG plat render, the theme system, and a passing test harness. Placement editing, conflict checking, flow, and the utilities graph are specified and scheduled but not yet wired.

## Repository layout

```
bayplan.html                     the instrument (open it, no build step)
bayplan-seed-library.json        built-in machine library (17 machines)
build_seed.py                    generator; source of truth for the seed
bayplan-data-model.md            full data-model spec and station arc
bayplan-envelope-conventions.md  local frame + default clearance depths
README.md
LICENSE
```

The seed embedded in `bayplan.html` is spliced in from `bayplan-seed-library.json` at scaffold-build time, so `build_seed.py` remains the single source. To regenerate: run `python3 build_seed.py`, then re-splice.

## Running it

Open `bayplan.html` in a browser. It runs from `file://` with no server, no network, and no build step. On first load it shows a small demo shop so the plat is not blank.

## Tests

The geometry test harness is browser-runnable at `bayplan.html#test`. It is seeded with the built-in library as its fixture and covers bounds with offset anchors, edge projection, point-in-polygon, the bearing convention, point-in-arc, the mirror transform, the placement transform, and a document round-trip. The release gate is green only when every assertion passes.

## Local frame convention

Origin at the machine anchor, +y back (away from the operator), +x to the operator's right. Footprint edges are named front (min y), back (max y), left (min x), right (max x). Arc angles are degrees clockwise from +y. See `bayplan-envelope-conventions.md` for the full convention and the default clearance depths per machine category.

## Known Limitations

- Placement is not yet editable in the UI. The demo scenario is fixed; you cannot drag, rotate, or add machines from within `bayplan.html` in this release.
- Conflict checking is not wired. The geometry to detect overlaps exists and is tested, but the checker that walks a scenario and reports hard, soft, and shared conflicts is not built.
- Material flow and the utilities graph are specified only. No flow paths, no duct runs, no load rollups yet.
- QUARTERMASTER seed import is designed (provenance fields are in the schema) but not implemented.
- Arc clearances render and test as filled wedges. Annular arcs (with an inner radius) are supported in the model and sampled correctly, but no seed machine exercises one yet.
- The plat export produces the on-screen title block only. A full printable plat with legend and revision block is a PLAT-station item, still open.
- Import validation is shallow. It checks for a facility and a scenarios array; it does not yet validate the full schema or migrate older schema versions.

## Roadmap

BAYPLAN runs an eight-station arc: SOUNDING (set the floor), MANIFEST (build the library), ENVELOPE (define the halos), STOWAGE (place), TRIM (balance conflicts), ROUTING (material flow), SERVICES (utilities graph), PLAT (compare and issue). This scaffold delivers ENVELOPE's built-in defaults and the render foundation. STOWAGE and TRIM are next. See the station arc in `bayplan-data-model.md`.
